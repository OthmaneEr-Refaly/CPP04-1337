// A virtual function is a function in a base class that can be overridden in a derived class, 
// and when you call it through a pointer or reference to the base, it will call the derived version.

// Polymorphism = "many forms" â†’ In C++, it means that a base class pointer or reference can 
// point to different derived class objects, and automatically call the correct function.
